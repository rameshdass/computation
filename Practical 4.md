# Practical 4 Assignment

Similar to the last exercise, you are going to make a change to this document, but you will make the change on the command line
using your local repository. (Review [this video](https://youtu.be/SoaAoATcUxU)) for guidance)

You will do the following:
1. Create a new branch called `assignment-edit` on the command line of your local repository on your computer.
2. Edit this document, `Practical 4 Assignment.md` by adding your name on the first line.
3. Once you have edited `Practical 4 Assignment.md`, push those changes to GitHub.
4. On GitHub create a Pull Request to merge these changes into the Master branch.
5. Delete the `assignment-edit` branch after the merge.

Take a screenshot of your command line showing that you have committed and pushed your change
and upload your screenshot to a new Issue titled `Practical 4 Assignment`.

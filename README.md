# Practical Guideline

## Setting up practical environment

1. Login to the practical server (hostname: `sdspractice.perdanauniversity.edu.my`) by using terminal/putty software.
2. Clone the practical materials from your own practical repository at GitHub, e.g.: `[centos@practice ~]$ git clone https://github.com/PU-SDS/BIC7206-Practical-2-farhansj.git`
3. Enter to the local practical Git repository, e.g.: `[centos@practice ~]$ cd BIC7206-Practical-2-farhansj`
4. Follow the practical instruction(s)

## Practical submission

For some of your practical assignments you may need create issues on GitHub. Usually, when you have to upload a screenshot. You also could create issues should you have any question or concern regarding your practical exercise.

In order to create an issue you will go to the tab marked as `Issues`:

![](/assets/issue_one.png)

Once you click on that tab you will see all the current issues in this repository. At this point, no issues have been created. Let's create a new issue by clicking `New issue`

![](/assets/issue_two.png)

Once you have created a new issue, you will be greeted by the screen below. Here you will provide
* A title for your issue (Every title should be the name of the assignment, so in this case it is "Practical Assignment")
* A body for your issue to write a response or upload a screenshot
* A submission button

However, there are some practical assignments that does not require you to create issues. But, you may need to upload the practical file(s) by using the `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` commands. Hence, please read the instruction carefully.
